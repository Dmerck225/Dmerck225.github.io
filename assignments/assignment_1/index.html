        <h1>Meet The Mets</h1>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.mlb.com/mets">New York Mets</a>, established in 1962, are one of two professional baseball teams that call New York home. The Mets were founded to replace the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants, who both left New York for California in 1957. Just seven years after their founding, the "Miricle Mets" won their first World Series in 1969. The Mets have won two World Series titles, the other coming in 1986.

            The teams identity is rooted in its iconic players and rich history. Mets legends include Tom Seaver, or "The Franchise", who was the first player inducted into the <a href="https://baseballhall.org/">Hall of Fame</a> as a Met. Seaver was a 12-time All-Star and three-time Cy Young Award winner. Other notable Mets include Mike Piazza, whose bat electrified the Mets' former home of Shea Stadium, and David Wright, who became the face of the franchise in the 2000s. Wright, often referred to as "Captain America," was a seven-time All-Star and served as the team's captain from 2013 until his retirement in 2018. His leadership on and off the field, combined with his consistent performance at third base, made him one of the most beloved figures in Mets history. These players, among others, have left an indelible mark on the team, contributing to the rich history that defines the Mets' identity today.
